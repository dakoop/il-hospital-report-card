Hip fractures, which are a common cause of morbidity and functional decline among elderly persons, are associated with a significant increase in the subsequent risk of mortality. Complications of hip fracture and other comorbidities lead to a relatively high mortality rate, and evidence suggests that some of these complications are preventable. Better processes of care may reduce mortality for hip fracture, which represents better quality.

Note:

The following caveats were identified from the literature review for the ""Hip Fracture Mortality Rate"" indicator:

    * Information biasa: This indicator is based on information available in hospital discharge data sets, but some missing information may actually be important to evaluating the outcomes of hospital care. Examination of missing information may help to improve indicator performance in these cases.
    * Confounding biasb: Patient characteristics may substantially affect the performance of the indicator, risk adjustment is recommended.
    * Unclear constructa: There is uncertainty or poor correlation with widely accepted process measures.

Widespread consensus exists that health care organizations can reduce patient injuries by improving the environment for safety from implementing technical changes, such as electronic medical record systems, to improving staff awareness of patient safety risks. Clinical process interventions also have strong evidence for reducing the risk of adverse events related to a patient's exposure to hospital care. Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), which are based on computerized hospital discharge abstracts from the AHRQ's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), can be used to better prioritize and evaluate local and national initiatives. Analyses of these and similar inexpensive, readily available administrative data sets may provide a screen for potential medical errors and a method for monitoring trends over time.

CLAB infections are the third leading cause of health care associated infections reported by the medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system. The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.","It is estimated that there are 25,000 cases of central line associated bloodstream (CLAB) infections that occur in the hospital annually with an estimated mortality of 12% to 25% for each infection. CLAB infections are the third leading cause of health care associated infections reported by the medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system. The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.
Healthcare associated infections account for an estimated 2 million infections and 90,000 deaths annually. Several published studies have magnified the potential for central line catheters to cause mortality and morbidity resulting from infectious complications. It is estimated in the United States that there are 15 million central line days (number of days in which there is a central line in place for a selected population during a selected time period) in the intensive care units each year. Approximately 80,000 CLAB infections occur in intensive care units each year in the United States.
The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reported in July 2007 the median rate of CLAB infections per 1,000 central line days in NHSN participating hospitals ranged from 1.9 in Major Teaching Medical Surgical ICUs to 2.2 in Medical ICUs. The attributed mortality for these CLAB infections is mixed in the literature. The documented studies range from no increase in mortality when controlled for severity of illness, to a 35% increase in mortality in prospective studies that did not control for severity of illness. Further research to clarify the mortality associated with CLAB infections is needed, but the available data are consistent with an attributable mortality of CLAB infections, ranging between 4% and 20%. These infections are associated with 2,400 to 20,000 deaths per year.
A study completed by Berenholtz et al, documents a decrease from 11.3 CLAB/1,000 central lines days in first quarter 1998 to 0 CLAB /1,000 central line days in fourth quarter 2002 in an ICU at John Hopkins. The study implemented all of the central line bundle recommendations, as well as provider education, designated line carts, and empowering the nursing staff to stop a procedure when CDC guidelines were not followed. Ongoing monitoring shows their improvement in performance was sustained once the project was completed. There was only 0.54/1,000 CLAB infections per central line days from January 2003 to April 2004 documented. It is estimated that their ICU project may have prevented up to 43 CLAB infections, eight deaths, and $1,945,922 ($1,483,844 - $2,408,000) in additional cost per year.
In 2001, the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative worked together with the technical assistance of the CDC towards a hospital-based intervention to prevent CLAB infections among intensive care unit patients in southwestern Pennsylvania. Thirty-two hospitals participated in this initiative, the median size of the participating hospitals was 215 beds (range 27 to 796). Of the 66 ICU participating, 48% were medical/surgical, 11% cardiothoracic, 14% coronary, 9% surgical, 6% neurosurgical, 5% trauma, 3% medical, 3% burn, and 3% pediatric. During the 4-year period from 4/2001-5/2005, CLAB infection rates among ICU patients declined 68%, from 4.31 to 1.36 per 1,000 central line days."

CLAB infections are the third leading cause of health care associated infections reported by the medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system. The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.","It is estimated that there are 25,000 cases of central line associated bloodstream (CLAB) infections that occur in the hospital annually with an estimated mortality of 12% to 25% for each infection. CLAB infections are the third leading cause of health care associated infections reported by the medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system. The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.
Healthcare associated infections account for an estimated 2 million infections and 90,000 deaths annually. Several published studies have magnified the potential for central line catheters to cause mortality and morbidity resulting from infectious complications. It is estimated in the United States that there are 15 million central line days (number of days in which there is a central line in place for a selected population during a selected time period) in the intensive care units each year. Approximately 80,000 CLAB infections occur in intensive care units each year in the United States.
The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reported in July 2007 the median rate of CLAB infections per 1,000 central line days in NHSN participating hospitals ranged from 1.9 in Major Teaching Medical Surgical ICUs to 2.2 in Medical ICUs. The attributed mortality for these CLAB infections is mixed in the literature. The documented studies range from no increase in mortality when controlled for severity of illness, to a 35% increase in mortality in prospective studies that did not control for severity of illness. Further research to clarify the mortality associated with CLAB infections is needed, but the available data are consistent with an attributable mortality of CLAB infections, ranging between 4% and 20%. These infections are associated with 2,400 to 20,000 deaths per year.
A study completed by Berenholtz et al, documents a decrease from 11.3 CLAB/1,000 central lines days in first quarter 1998 to 0 CLAB /1,000 central line days in fourth quarter 2002 in an ICU at John Hopkins. The study implemented all of the central line bundle recommendations, as well as provider education, designated line carts, and empowering the nursing staff to stop a procedure when CDC guidelines were not followed. Ongoing monitoring shows their improvement in performance was sustained once the project was completed. There was only 0.54/1,000 CLAB infections per central line days from January 2003 to April 2004 documented. It is estimated that their ICU project may have prevented up to 43 CLAB infections, eight deaths, and $1,945,922 ($1,483,844 - $2,408,000) in additional cost per year.
In 2001, the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative worked together with the technical assistance of the CDC towards a hospital-based intervention to prevent CLAB infections among intensive care unit patients in southwestern Pennsylvania. Thirty-two hospitals participated in this initiative, the median size of the participating hospitals was 215 beds (range 27 to 796). Of the 66 ICU participating, 48% were medical/surgical, 11% cardiothoracic, 14% coronary, 9% surgical, 6% neurosurgical, 5% trauma, 3% medical, 3% burn, and 3% pediatric. During the 4-year period from 4/2001-5/2005, CLAB infection rates among ICU patients declined 68%, from 4.31 to 1.36 per 1,000 central line days."

CLAB infections are the third leading cause of health care associated infections reported by the medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system. The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.","It is estimated that there are 25,000 cases of central line associated bloodstream (CLAB) infections that occur in the hospital annually with an estimated mortality of 12% to 25% for each infection. CLAB infections are the third leading cause of health care associated infections reported by the medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system. The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.
Healthcare associated infections account for an estimated 2 million infections and 90,000 deaths annually. Several published studies have magnified the potential for central line catheters to cause mortality and morbidity resulting from infectious complications. It is estimated in the United States that there are 15 million central line days (number of days in which there is a central line in place for a selected population during a selected time period) in the intensive care units each year. Approximately 80,000 CLAB infections occur in intensive care units each year in the United States.
The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reported in July 2007 the median rate of CLAB infections per 1,000 central line days in NHSN participating hospitals ranged from 1.9 in Major Teaching Medical Surgical ICUs to 2.2 in Medical ICUs. The attributed mortality for these CLAB infections is mixed in the literature. The documented studies range from no increase in mortality when controlled for severity of illness, to a 35% increase in mortality in prospective studies that did not control for severity of illness. Further research to clarify the mortality associated with CLAB infections is needed, but the available data are consistent with an attributable mortality of CLAB infections, ranging between 4% and 20%. These infections are associated with 2,400 to 20,000 deaths per year.
A study completed by Berenholtz et al, documents a decrease from 11.3 CLAB/1,000 central lines days in first quarter 1998 to 0 CLAB /1,000 central line days in fourth quarter 2002 in an ICU at John Hopkins. The study implemented all of the central line bundle recommendations, as well as provider education, designated line carts, and empowering the nursing staff to stop a procedure when CDC guidelines were not followed. Ongoing monitoring shows their improvement in performance was sustained once the project was completed. There was only 0.54/1,000 CLAB infections per central line days from January 2003 to April 2004 documented. It is estimated that their ICU project may have prevented up to 43 CLAB infections, eight deaths, and $1,945,922 ($1,483,844 - $2,408,000) in additional cost per year.
In 2001, the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative worked together with the technical assistance of the CDC towards a hospital-based intervention to prevent CLAB infections among intensive care unit patients in southwestern Pennsylvania. Thirty-two hospitals participated in this initiative, the median size of the participating hospitals was 215 beds (range 27 to 796). Of the 66 ICU participating, 48% were medical/surgical, 11% cardiothoracic, 14% coronary, 9% surgical, 6% neurosurgical, 5% trauma, 3% medical, 3% burn, and 3% pediatric. During the 4-year period from 4/2001-5/2005, CLAB infection rates among ICU patients declined 68%, from 4.31 to 1.36 per 1,000 central line days."

These hospitals house the most sophisticated medical technology in the world and provide state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic services. But access to these services comes with certain costs. About 30% of personal health care expenditures in the United States go towards hospital care, and the rate of growth in spending for hospital services has only recently leveled out after several years of increases following a half a decade of declining growth. Simultaneously, concerns about the quality of health care services have reached a crescendo with the Institute of Medicine's series of reports describing the problem of medical errors and the need for a complete restructuring of the health care system to improve the quality of care. Policymakers, employers, and consumers have made the quality of care in U.S. hospitals a top priority and have voiced the need to assess, monitor, track, and improve the quality of inpatient care.

Widespread consensus exists that health care organizations can reduce patient injuries by improving the environment for safety from implementing technical changes, such as electronic medical record systems, to improving staff awareness of patient safety risks. Clinical process interventions also have strong evidence for reducing the risk of adverse events related to a patient's exposure to hospital care. Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), which are based on computerized hospital discharge abstracts from the AHRQ's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), can be used to better prioritize and evaluate local and national initiatives. Analyses of these and similar inexpensive, readily available administrative data sets may provide a screen for potential medical errors and a method for monitoring trends over time.

*The following concerns affect the validity of this indicator:

    * Underreporting or screening: Conditions included in this indicator may not be systematically reported (leading to an artificially low rate) or may be routinely screened for (leading to a higher rate in facilities that screen).
    * Unclear preventability: As compared to other Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), the conditions included in this indicator may be less preventable by the health system.

The Iatrogenic Pneumothorax indicator is intended to flag cases of pneumothorax caused by medical care. This indicator is defined on both a provider level* (by including all cases of iatrogenic pneumothorax occurring as a secondary diagnosis during hospitalization) and on an area level (by including all cases of iatrogenic pneumothorax) (see the related National Quality Measures Clearinghouse [NQMC] summary of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ] indicator Iatrogenic pneumothorax (area-level): rate per 100,000 population).
Iatrogenic pneumothorax excludes all trauma patients because these patients may be more susceptible to non-preventable iatrogenic pneumothorax or may be miscoded for traumatic pneumothorax.
*The following concern affects the validity of this indicator:
Denominator unspecific: The denominator for this indicator is less than ideal, because the true population at risk could not be identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Some patients are likely included who are not truly at risk, or some patients who are at risk are not included.

It is estimated that their ICU project may have prevented up to 43 CLAB infections, eight deaths, and $1,945,922 ($1,483,844 - $2,408,000) in additional cost per year.
In 2001, the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative worked together with the technical assistance of the CDC towards a hospital-based intervention to prevent CLAB infections among intensive care unit patients in southwestern Pennsylvania. Thirty-two hospitals participated in this initiative; the median size of the participating hospitals was 215 beds (range 27 to 796). Of the 66 ICU participating, 48% were medical/surgical, 11% cardiothoracic, 14% coronary, 9% surgical, 6% neurosurgical, 5% trauma, 3% medical, 3% burn, and 3% pediatric. During the 4-year period from 4/2001-5/2005, CLAB infection rates among ICU patients declined 68%, from 4.31 to 1.36 per 1,000 central line days."

The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.
Healthcare associated infections account for an estimated 2 million infections and 90,000 deaths annually. Several published studies have magnified the potential for central line catheters to cause mortality and morbidity resulting from infectious complications. It is estimated in the United States that there are 15 million central line days (number of days in which there is a central line in place for a selected population during a selected time period) in the intensive care units each year. Approximately 80,000 CLAB infections occur in intensive care units each year in the United States.
The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reported in July 2007 the median rate of CLAB infections per 1,000 central line days in NHSN participating hospitals ranged from 1.9 in Major Teaching Medical Surgical ICUs to 2.2 in Medical ICUs. The attributed mortality for these CLAB infections is mixed in the literature. The documented studies range from no increase in mortality when controlled for severity of illness, to a 35% increase in mortality in prospective studies that did not control for severity of illness. Further research to clarify the mortality associated with CLAB infections is needed, but the available data are consistent with an attributable mortality of CLAB infections, ranging between 4% and 20%. These infections are associated with 2,400 to 20,000 deaths per year.
A study completed by Berenholtz et al, documents a decrease from 11.3 CLAB/1,000 central lines days in first quarter 1998 to 0 CLAB /1,000 central line days in fourth quarter 2002 in an ICU at John Hopkins.

The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reported in July 2007 the median rate of CLAB infections per 1,000 central line days in NHSN participating hospitals ranged from 1.9 in Major Teaching Medical Surgical ICUs to 2.2 in Medical ICUs. The attributed mortality for these CLAB infections is mixed in the literature. The documented studies range from no increase in mortality when controlled for severity of illness, to a 35% increase in mortality in prospective studies that did not control for severity of illness. Further research to clarify the mortality associated with CLAB infections is needed, but the available data are consistent with an attributable mortality of CLAB infections, ranging between 4% and 20%. These infections are associated with 2,400 to 20,000 deaths per year.
A study completed by Berenholtz et al, documents a decrease from 11.3 CLAB/1,000 central lines days in first quarter 1998 to 0 CLAB /1,000 central line days in fourth quarter 2002 in an ICU at John Hopkins. The study implemented all of the central line bundle recommendations, as well as provider education, designated line carts, and empowering the nursing staff to stop a procedure when CDC guidelines were not followed. Ongoing monitoring shows their improvement in performance was sustained once the project was completed. There was only 0.54/1,000 CLAB infections per central line days from January 2003 to April 2004 documented. It is estimated that their ICU project may have prevented up to 43 CLAB infections, eight deaths, and $1,945,922 ($1,483,844 - $2,408,000) in additional cost per year.
In 2001, the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative worked together with the technical assistance of the CDC towards a hospital-based intervention to prevent CLAB infections among intensive care unit patients in southwestern Pennsylvania. Thirty-two hospitals participated in this initiative; the median size of the participating hospitals was 215 beds (range 27 to 796). Of the 66 ICU participating, 48% were medical/surgical, 11% cardiothoracic, 14% coronary, 9% surgical, 6% neurosurgical, 5% trauma, 3% medical, 3% burn, and 3% pediatric. During the 4-year period from 4/2001-5/2005, CLAB infection rates among ICU patients declined 68%, from 4.31 to 1.36 per 1,000 central line days."

In spite of formal guidelines, pulmonary embolism is the most common preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients, causing or contributing to 5% to 10% of all in-hospital deaths. A study at a large teaching hospital found that potentially preventable cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) represented two-thirds of all VTE cases where prophylaxis was indicated, with 47.7% due to failure to give any prophylaxis, 22.7% because of inadequate duration, or 20% due to incorrect type of prophylaxis. Almost one-half of all VTEs occurring in the community are related to recent hospitalization, either for major surgery or for acute medical illness.

Gillies and colleagues identified three groups of surgical patients less likely to receive prophylaxis: moderate-risk patients, emergency admission, and conservatively treated patients. Failure to prevent VTE can result in delayed hospital discharge or readmission, increased risk for long-term morbidity from post-thrombotic syndrome, and recurrent thrombosis in the future.","The concept of ""failure to prevent"" has generated interest in national health policy organizations to identify evidence-based practice that will improve patient safety in the hospital setting.

CLAB infections are the third leading cause of health care associated infections reported by the medical/surgical intensive care units (ICUs) participating in the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system.

The CDC has identified catheter-associated adverse events as one of its Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges with the goal of reducing catheter-related adverse events by 50% within the next five years.
Healthcare associated infections account for an estimated 2 million infections and 90,000 deaths annually. Several published studies have magnified the potential for central line catheters to cause mortality and morbidity resulting from infectious complications. It is estimated in the United States that there are 15 million central line days (number of days in which there is a central line in place for a selected population during a selected time period) in the intensive care units each year. Approximately 80,000 CLAB infections occur in intensive care units each year in the United States.
The CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) reported in July 2007 the median rate of CLAB infections per 1,000 central line days in NHSN participating hospitals ranged from 1.9 in Major Teaching Medical Surgical ICUs to 2.2 in Medical ICUs. The attributed mortality for these CLAB infections is mixed in the literature. The documented studies range from no increase in mortality when controlled for severity of illness, to a 35% increase in mortality in prospective studies that did not control for severity of illness. Further research to clarify the mortality associated with CLAB infections is needed, but the available data are consistent with an attributable mortality of CLAB infections, ranging between 4% and 20%. These infections are associated with 2,400 to 20,000 deaths per year.
A study completed by Berenholtz et al, documents a decrease from 11.3 CLAB/1,000 central lines days in first quarter 1998 to 0 CLAB /1,000 central line days in fourth quarter 2002 in an ICU at John Hopkins. The study implemented all of the central line bundle recommendations, as well as provider education, designated line carts, and empowering the nursing staff to stop a procedure when CDC guidelines were not followed. Ongoing monitoring shows their improvement in performance was sustained once the project was completed. There was only 0.54/1,000 CLAB infections per central line days from January 2003 to April 2004 documented. It is estimated that their ICU project may have prevented up to 43 CLAB infections, eight deaths, and $1,945,922 ($1,483,844 - $2,408,000) in additional cost per year.
In 2001, the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative worked together with the technical assistance of the CDC towards a hospital-based intervention to prevent CLAB infections among intensive care unit patients in southwestern Pennsylvania. Thirty-two hospitals participated in this initiative; the median size of the participating hospitals was 215 beds (range 27 to 796). Of the 66 ICU participating, 48% were medical/surgical, 11% cardiothoracic, 14% coronary, 9% surgical, 6% neurosurgical, 5% trauma, 3% medical, 3% burn, and 3% pediatric. During the 4-year period from 4/2001-5/2005, CLAB infection rates among ICU patients declined 68%, from 4.31 to 1.36 per 1,000 central line days."
